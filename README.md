# Terminal MP3 Player

It's been fun to build my first completed project on github. This project was build from another projects that lying on github but somewhat feel incomplete, so I copy, modified, and add my own codes to it until I feel satisfied. However, there is one feature that I want to add, that is play all, but the documentation of pygame said that it's only made for one stream at a time, so I think it's never gonna be quite easy to build and modify a bit of code from it. Possible, but not easy enough to build.

## Getting started

* To run this code you have to have [python](https://www.python.org/)
* another prerequisite that you must have is you must install [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/), I suggest to install it with [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) but feel free to install it with other methods you'd like

## Authors

* **Paulus Triswandani** - *Initial work*

## License

I don't really know much about license, but if this program is to be copied and spread, I'd like it to be [GPL version 3](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt) licensed.

## Known Issues

* One thing I know and I don't know how to fix it (easily), is it doesn't play mp3 files that have japanese tags. I don't know with other contries tags, but maybe they doesn't work too
